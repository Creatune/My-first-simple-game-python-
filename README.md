# My-first-simple-game-python-
I just started learning python (not more than a week ago). This is a very simple game that asks the user a few simple riddles/questions.


In this repo, I will upload my python file (game.py) that should be manually run on terminal by the user..... I do not know how to publish python files as games XD.
